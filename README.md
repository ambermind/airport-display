# MINIMACY Example: Airport display. Who needs crowdstrike?
On July 19th 2024, a lot of airports and other infrastructures encountered blue screens, and freezed computers. It turned out this was caused by a wrong update of the embedded crowdstrike security probe. Even on basic devices which only display next departures, people had add up a lot of stuff and complexity nobody was aware of.

This program demonstrates how to:
- implement a simple departure airport display
- get live information from an external source
- create a bitmap and write text in it
- manage multi-pages display
- use timer to refresh the list of departures

This demo works on any platform including baremetal Raspberry Pi.

## About MINIMACY
Computing is something too serious to be left to machines.
Humans must be able to understand 100% of what's going on in the machine. Otherwise, there can be no serious talk of cybersecurity or sovereignty.
No technology allows it today... except MINIMACY!

MINIMACY is an open-source minimalist computation system based on the principle “Less is more”, so that a single human can understand 100% of the system operation.
It is designed and programmed by [Sylvain Huet](https://sylvain-huet.com/).
